**Problem Statement:**
Suicide is a critical public health issue, and understanding its trends can help policymakers and mental health professionals design better intervention strategies. This study aims to analyze suicide data in India from 2001 to 2012 to identify patterns based on demographics, causes, and geographical distribution. The goal is to uncover insights that can aid in preventing suicides and improving mental health support.

**Proposed Solution:**
To address this problem, we propose a data-driven approach using Python. The methodology involves:
1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: Loading and cleaning the dataset to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing trends in suicide rates across different states, genders, age groups, and causes.
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Identifying correlations between socioeconomic factors and suicide rates.
4. **Machine Learning (if applicable)**: Implementing predictive modeling to forecast future trends or identify high-risk groups.
5. **Insights & Recommendations**: Summarizing findings and suggesting policy interventions.

# Suicide Data Analysis (India 2001-2012)

## Overview
This project analyzes suicide trends in India between 2001 and 2012 to provide insights into demographic and socioeconomic factors influencing suicide rates.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy for data processing
- Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization
- Scikit-learn (if machine learning is applied)

## Steps to Run the Notebook
1. Install required libraries: `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn`
2. Load the dataset (included in the project folder)
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook step by step to visualize and analyze the data

## Key Findings
- Suicide rates vary significantly across states.
- Gender and age are major influencing factors.
- Socioeconomic factors such as education and employment status correlate with suicide trends.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement predictive models to forecast suicide trends.
- Develop an interactive dashboard for real-time analysis.
